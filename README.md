# qfest-event-manager
====================

This is an event management software basically for managing Registrations for an event such as a College Technical Fest or as inter-School Competition registration. Please check the Wiki pages to know more details about this project.

### How to run this project on your localhost
===============================

First of all open the Terminal and change the directory to htdoc/www folder of your corresponding Apache Tool (eg: XAMPP, WAMPP , LAMPP) . And then clone this git repository using the git command

> git clone https://github.com/QFest/qfest-event-manager.git

Now take your browser and go to the below link and fill out the database and admin page details

> http://localhost/qfest-event-manager/install/

Thats all, now go to the below link to login to admin panel

> http://localhost/qfest-event-manager/admin/login


Currently to add new events you need to manually add it using PHPMySQL , once you install the database you will have a dump data to work with to make any changes as you wish. We will be adding backend for inserting event details in our next update. But as of now you will have to add the event part yourself.

You can see the online registration link from here :
